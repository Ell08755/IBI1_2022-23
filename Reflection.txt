*I tried to use the git on ZJE server. Unfortunately, it failed to connect and let me clone down(maybe also push up) the essential files that are needed.
 I think maybe it's the problem of firewall, so I download git on my own computer to work. See you tomorrow!

*It's really nice that the code works on git. 
*Don't forget to git init to start a new repository, and turn on your vpn.
*Always remember to add the modified file to repository before you want to commit the change!
*Be careful with the typo...For exmaple, index-Index(wrong)
 I struggle for the whole night thinking why my own website only shows 404, and find the 'Index" :(
*when git ask you your identification, just show it your email
*some possible "shortcut"
i for insert commit when you are pushing/merging
":x"":wq""Esc" can be used for escaping some windows
touching Fnum+Fn to show their basic function
*"vi" and "nano" can be used for create and modify a file

My friend can't push her file up to the github, here is the problem timeline
------1-----------------------2--------------------3-------------------------4------------
 clone repo down     edit sth on website   edit sth in local   try to push commit, falta
so, the problem is between 2 and 3, there is some conflict between local version and cloud version, which leads to error
so maybe it's better to "git pull" every time you begin your work and push after you finish them all.

*edit file
 nano <filename> edit + CtrlX + Y + Enter(this step you can change the filename)
 and if you change the filename at this step, you will do a "Save as" action
 vi <filename> i(enter insert mode) + edit + Esc(enter command mode) + :wq(to exit)
 always remember to write the suffix!
^Small tips:
*scroll mouse to change the cursor place
*as you highlight part of text in git, you already paste them
*when you want to talk about a file which has blank in its filename, remember to use ''
 e.g. nano 'hello world.txt'
^maybe useful solution to "git Recv failure: Connection was reset"
remove former origin: git remote remove origin
set up new origin: git remote add origin http://github.com/×××
