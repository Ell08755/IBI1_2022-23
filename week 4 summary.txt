week 4 summary
some git and github knowledges
^knowledge
commit(日常存档),tag(发布会/成就),revert (撤回),branch,merge,log
常用退出方式：“:x" ":wq" "q"
^command
*git init
 set up a git repository
*git add <file>
 Add file to git repository
 notice: <, 即pointy bracket，在实际书写过程中不加，在这里只是表示从你的电脑里insert到git去
*git commit -m "message you want to say"
 每次commit之前一定记得把新的文件先add回去
*git checkout HEAD
 Reads latest version from local repository into working directory 
*git revert
 git revert <commit number>
 git revert HEAD---revert back to last commit version, escape by ":x"
*git branch
 git branch <branch name> --- create a new branch
 git checkout <branch name> --- switch to branch
 e.g. git checkout master
 git branch --- check which branch you are on
*git merge
 git merge <branch name> --- Merge <branch name> into current branchv(before doing that, always make sure you are on the right branch)
 Merge can create conflicts, resolve them
*log
 git log --oneline---see the commit history
*edit file
 nano <filename> edit + CtrlX + Y + Enter(this step you can change the filename)
 vi <filename> i(enter insert mode) + edit + Esc(enter command mode) + :wq(to exit)
 always remember to write the suffix!
*fork (in github)
 creat a version of exisiting github repository
*clone
 create a local copy of a github repository
 e.g. git clone URL
*git push
 Push changes to Github
 e.g. git push origin master(sometimes "main")
*git fetch
 Get changes from github
*git pull
 Git fetch + git merge 
^Small tips:
*scroll mouse to change the cursor place
*as you highlight part of text in git, you already paste them
*when you want to talk about a file which has blank in its filename, remember to use ''
 e.g. nano 'hello world.txt'
^maybe useful solution to "git Recv failure: Connection was reset"
remove former origin: git remote remove origin
set up new origin: git remote add origin http://github.com/×××
