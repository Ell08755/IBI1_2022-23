(1) the alignment score and (2) the percentage of identical amino acids for each of the three comparisons. 

Your interpretation should state which of the two speciesâ€™ sequences are most closely related and what biological or evolutionary interpretation you think we can make from these data.

Cat and Mouse
alignment score: 3592
percentage Ident: 82.00%

Cat and Human
alignment score: 3717
percentage Ident: 85.00%

Mouse and Human
alignment score: 3579
percentage Ident: 82.00%

Cat and human sequences are most closely related, which suggests a close link between them during evolution compared to mice.
